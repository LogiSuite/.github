# Vision

We are developing a comprehensive open-source toolchain for a logistics and transportation platform, designed to provide interconnected microservices. The vision is to create an integrated platform where all data is seamlessly linked, enabling efficient management, real-time insights, and end-to-end visibility across the entire logistics ecosystem. By connecting services and centralizing information, the platform aims to streamline operations, improve decision-making, and foster collaboration across all stakeholders.

All components of this project are fully open source, ensuring transparency, collaboration, and community-driven development.
